This project studied the Earnings along the Time regarding the Gap between Genders based on the US Buraue Labor Census data.  

Talk Track:

Why are you here and not somewhere else?  We paid a good chunk of money to take this course, expecting to get exposure to the tools required 
to help us elevate and/or pivot our careers.

Our primary goal was to answer the following questions:
Do we earn more with education?
Does it vary by gender?

Have we bridged the gender pay gap over the past 20 years?  If so, does the gap narrow depending on education level?
Does wage growth (over 20 years) vary by gender?




Has the gender pay gap improved over the years?  
Does it vary by education level?

Does wage growth vary by gender?

According to the brief check (by Elizabeth) for the merging following two datasets: 

Income | https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas (Vanessa and Sabastian)
Education | https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ers.usda.gov%2Fwebdocs%2FDataFiles%2F48747%2FEducation.xlsx%3Fv%3D166.2&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK (Vanessa and Sabastian)

We should be able to conclude something on the topic of "Income vs Education Level" and meet the basic project requirements by this weekend. The predictable challenges are:
1) the region format difference between the two datasets, if use New York - This could be overcome by using another region or choosing for the whole country
2) the time format difference between the two datasets - This should be able to be fixed by building a Education time series model first, then use this model to estimate the values for the year of 2020, 2021, and 2022 and related it to the Income data.     
3) The datasets could be too small and not enough for higher quality work. The following link provided extra datasets to compensate:

Projectwise, the major roles of each teammember were defined by the background, strength and interest (Dawn):

Project ideation - all;
Data fetching - Elizabeth;
Data exploration - Vanessa, Elizabeth, and all;
Data transformation - Elizabeth;
Data analysis - Dennis, Dawn, and all;
Testing - Elizabeth, Sabastian;
Creating documentation - Dennis;
Creating the visualization, presentation - Dawn
Reh - Dawn, Sabastian, and all.

Project Scope:
Objective: 1) Practice learned concepts and skills for M0-M8; 2) Mimic working as an AI engineer; 3) Win high score to graduate from BCS. 
Scope: Find out the relationship between the Income and Education Level based on the above mentioned two major datasets (to reach score 60+). Explore extra datasets to support, compensate, interpret or comment the conclusion (to reach score 90+)
Deliverable: code for submission and 8 charts for presentation
Constraint: 
- by Tuesday, 7 May 2024, project scope ready for discussion;
- by Sunday, 12 May 2024, all work done to the level of enough to meet the basic project requirements;
- by Monday, 13 May 2024, complete the discussion on weather to merge extra datasets and finish the work if decided to do so;
- by Tuesday, 14 May 2024, small adjustments upon agreement, finalize the presentaion and submit, decide the presenting format and perform rehearsement
- Thursday, presentation
Assumptions: 1) All members have the fundamental understanding and skills for what have learned; 2) Everyone is busy and the class time, 18 hours, is enough for everything to be done; 3) All members have the goal to meet the basic project requirements and would like to make effort for higher score; 4) Roles are defined for each memeber, while everyone has the responsibility to help others.
